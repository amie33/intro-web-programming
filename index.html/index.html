  <h3 class="margin">My Reflection</h3><br>
	<p>Let me just start out by saying this is my first web development class I have ever taken, and I can say without a doubt I have found another thing I am passionate about.  While on the computer science path I have had classes I liked and some not so much, so far CSIS 1430 has been my most favorite class, and I feel that I have figured out "what I want to be when I grow up."</p>
	<p>This course really allowed for my creative side to present itself, and I think that is what I love and appreciate most about web development.  From the get go HTML allowed me to get down some of the fundamentals, such as how to layout a webpage.  I learned the difference between tags and attributes and when to utilize them in my HTML code.  I learned how to make my webpage look more appealing to my audience utilizing CSS.  I also learned how to write id's and classes within my HTML code to make using my CSS more efficent.  Then came JavaScript! I don't consider myself a great programmer, I have some knowledge in Java and have dabbled with other computer languages so I was very nervous when it came time to learn JavaScript concepts.  For me personally I found that writing JavaScript was much easier than I anticipated! I really enjoyed being able to create functions in JavaScript as they pertained to the functionality to my webpage.</p>
	<p>I really loved this class and I recommend it to anyone considering computer science/web development.  I also have to give a shout out to my favorite professor Jeff Stone.  I think he does an excellent job at teaching the material and really allows for his students to tap into their creative side and have fun.  Again I learned so much from this class and really enjoyed my time learning the material. If I could I'd take it agian, I totally would!</p>
